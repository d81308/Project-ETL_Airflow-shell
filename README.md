# Project-ETL_Airflow-shell
## Summary
* Our project aims to complete an ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) process. ETL is a data processing method used to extract data from one system, transform it, and load it into another system. 
* We use shell scripts to complete the extraction, transformation, and loading processes, and use the airflow tool to schedule these shell scripts. Our goal is to create an efficient and stable ETL system to help businesses better manage and analyze data, leading to more informed business decisions.
